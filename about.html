    <h1>About Collaborative Studies</h1>
    <p>A discipleship community engaging in story work, spiritual formation, and presence with God and others.</p>
</section>

<section class="about-content">
    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>Collaborative Studies exists to cultivate a community of believers committed to deep spiritual formation, shared vulnerability, and the transformative love of Jesus. Through intentional relationships and spiritual practices, we seek to embody and extend the presence of God in our everyday lives.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>We believe discipleship happens in relationship‚Äîfirst with God, then with ourselves, and finally with one another. Collaborative Studies provides spaces for people to engage in **story work, spiritual rhythms, and presence** to deepen their faith journey.</p>

    <h2>Our Core Commitments</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Story Work</strong> ‚Äì Understanding how our personal narratives shape our faith, relationships, and purpose.</li>
        <li><strong>Formation</strong> ‚Äì Engaging in the spiritual rhythms of Jesus to shape our identity and daily life.</li>
        <li><strong>Presence</strong> ‚Äì Learning to be fully present with God, others, and ourselves in an increasingly distracted world.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Discipleship Pathways</h2>
    <p>To live out these commitments, Collaborative Studies offers three key discipleship experiences:</p>
